# Celtic Tours code institute Google Maps API

This web site was set up for the fictional company Celtic tours. Its purpose was to allow anyone planning a holiday in the British
Isles, to search for a city in one of the 5 countries Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, England or Wales and by selecting one of
the types Hotel, Restaurant, bars or site seeing activities and pressing submit the google map would pan to the location and highlight
a number of the select types e.g. hotels with an appropriate icon. Then through the form they contact the company who could either

## UX

### What is this website for?
